## Stealth-Monitor

According to the legend, once upon a time someone needed to have a bash script running on some Linux boxes in order to 
have a screenshot taken on those machines.

The script needed to run stealthy, take a snapshot of whatever was present in the screen at that time, and upload that screenshot to a preconfigured FTP server.

This was the solution used at that time. Probably not the best one, surely one that worked.

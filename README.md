## Stealth-Monitor

This repo was created for historical reasons. The idea was to keep a record of a solution used once because of the need of having a bash script running on a couple of Linux boxes taking and sending periodical screenshots to a configured destination.

The script had to run stealthy, take a snapshot of whatever was present in the screen at that time, and upload it to an FTP server.
